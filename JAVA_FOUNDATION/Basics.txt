What is Java?
    Java was found in 1991 and officially released version 1.0 in 1995 its name that time was Ook. James Gosling is the father of Java. It was owned by Sun MicroSystem until 2010
After 2010 Java was undertaken by Oracle corporation. 

       
1. Describe the features of Java?

       1. Platform independent - Can be complied on any OS 
       2. Java is both compiler and interptreter Language
       3. Robustness - It strictly checks for datatypes
              example : 
                     int a = 10;
                     int b = "Raja";
       4. Java Packages 
              Libraries are imported as packages 
              Syntax: import java.util.*;


2. Describe the real-world applications of Java?

       Java have three editions in real-world applications

       1. Standart Edition(Java SE)
        Used to develop Desktop Application like chrome, FireFox

       2. Enterprice Edition
        Used to develop Ecart Apps like Amazon, Flipkart

       3. Micro Edition
        Used to develop Mobile Apps like WhatsApp


JAVA BASICS

1. Describe the Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) ?
       1. JDK
                     Java Development Kit is a simple toolkit for developers
                     Things inside:
                            • Javac → compiles .java → .class
                            • Java (JVM launcher) → runs your program
                            • Libraries → ready-made Java code
                            • Tools → debugger, documentation generator, etc.
                     We need JDK to :
                            • To write Java program
                            • To compile java program
                            • Run java program 

2. Describe the components of object-oriented programming?

       Everything Should be written inside class 



3. Describe the components of a basic Java program?

       Three types: 
              1. JDK
                     Java Development Kit is a simple toolkit for developers
                     Things inside:
                            • Javac → compiles .java → .class
                            • Java (JVM launcher) → runs your program
                            • Libraries → ready-made Java code
                            • Tools → debugger, documentation generator, etc.
                     We need JDK to :
                            • To write Java program
                            • To compile java program
                            • Run java program 
                            
              2. JRE 
                     Java Runtime Environment 

              3. JVM 
                     Java Virtual Machine
                     It’s a virtual computer inside real computer that runs Java programs.
                     Java doesn’t run directly on Windows/Linux/Mac.It runs inside the JVM.

                     code (.java)
                            ↓ compile
                     Bytecode (.class)
                            ↓ run inside
                     JVM
                            ↓
                     Program runs


4.Compile and execute a Java program?


       1. Compilation 
       command : javac filename.java

       2. Execution
       During Execution a class file will be created for the java file 
       Class name and File name are preferred to be same
       command : java filename.java
